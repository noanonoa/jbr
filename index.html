  The blends of a unique producer and passionate artist only begin to paint the picture of JB Russell. Tracing his roots to the proud city of Chicago, JB has been doused in music since his infancy. Growing up in a household filled with the sounds of soulful R&B, Gospel, Pop, Funk, and Hip-Hop, the natural order of osmosis would have it that this early connection to the world of music would become JB’s passion. From dancing to songs like George Clinton’s “One Nation under a Groove” as a toddler at family cookouts to now writing, producing, and engineering his own music as well as music for others.

  JB began rapping and singing at the age of 7. Simply mimicking his favorite songs on the radio. Over the years of his adolescence he would grow and better his craft by freestyling with his cousins and friends.  At the age of 8 he joined his elementary school orchestra and played the Viola and would switch to band and pick up playing the Trombone by 10. He began writing rap lyrics by the age of 12 and making his own beats at 15. He started out making Hip-Hop but grew to test his skills in other genres as well. Continuing to further hone his skills in music production, he became a self-taught pianist. He began writing songs outside of Hip-Hop and self-recorded his first slew of songs in 2010. He would later come to realize that In 2012 he would set out to pursue his passion taking his music aspirations to the next level. Constantly performing, writing, producing, and recording to perfect his craft and develop his artistry has helped him evolve into the artist he is today. JB would find his way to Nashville in 2015 to make his pursuits even more of a a reality. JB is putting in the work to be next up on the scene!
